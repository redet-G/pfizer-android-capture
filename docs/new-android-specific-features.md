### Org unit

The whole organisation unit tree is displayed. Organisation units not available for data entry will be colored in grey.
User must check the box to select the org unit wanted.


> **Caution**
>
>  Mobile users are not expected to access the org. unit hierarchy of a whole country. Maximum number of org units is difficult to set, as the App does not set the limit, but the resources on the device (memory, processor). We could say below 250 org units should be safe, but still believe that is a very big number for a mobile use case.

### Differentiating tracker and event programs

> **Tip**
>
>  An easy way to differentiate program is by looking at the word at the bottom left corner. The word 'Event' will always be in event programs. In tracker will appear the name of the tracked entity type (person, patient, building, etc.).
